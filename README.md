## favorite food: biryani<\h1>
**Biryani** is a rich and flavorful Layered **Indian** dish.
Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with **lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy** which makes it more delicious and i enjoy every bite of it.<br>
