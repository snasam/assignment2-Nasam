## favorite food: biryani

**Biryani** is a rich and flavorful Layered **Indian** dish.<br>
Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with **lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy** which makes it more delicious and i enjoy every bite of it.
